Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

This project demonstrates the use of neural networks for breast cancer classification. It utilizes a dataset to build, train, and evaluate a neural network model to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model architecture, training, evaluation, and performance metrics.
